        abstract = {JACO (Kinova Technology, Montreal, QC, Canada) is an assistive robotic manipulator that is gaining popularity for its ability to assist individuals with physical impairments in activities of daily living. To accommodate a wider range of user population especially those with severe physical limitations, alternative control methods need to be developed. In this paper, we presented a vision-based assistive robotic manipulation assistance algorithm (AROMA) for JACO, which uses a low-cost 3D depth sensing camera and an improved inverse kinematic algorithm to enable semi-autonomous or autonomous operation of the JACO. The benchtop tests on a series of grasping tasks showed that the AROMA was able to reliably determine target gripper poses. The success rates for the grasping tasks ranged from 85\% to 100\% for different objects.}

abstract = {Aiming to reduce the labour cost and improve the competitiveness of the tea production, this paper presents a complete solution, including the mechanical structure, the visual recognition system (VRS) and the motion control system of the high-quality tea automatic plucking robot. The design objectives involve high reliability and stability, ease of maintenance, cost-effectiveness, accurate recognition and localization of tea shoots, and high-efficient plucking manipulation. The VRS is established using the computer vision together with corresponding machine learning algorithms, where the Particle swarm optimization-Support vector machine algorithm and the deep convolutional neural YOLOv3 model are developed to recognize the tender tea shoots and localize the plucking point, according to the images captured by the global and local cameras, respectively. The Delta parallel manipulator equipped with a shear cutter is adopted to execute the trajectory tracking and tea plucking operations. The improved ant colony algorithm is utilized for path planning and trajectory smoothing of the manipulator. Simulation and laboratory platform experiment results verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the presented solution.}
